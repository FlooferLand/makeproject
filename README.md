# makeproject
Python scripts to easily set up VSCode projects (including run and build tasks)

## Why?
VSCode requires quite a bit of work to set up projects, so i made this scrpt to automate it (and added a batch script to my OS path to easily run these scripts from anywhere)

## Errors
If you get something like "g++ is missing" while compiling a project made with mp-cpp it means the script can't find g++ (which is the compiler set by default in the tasks template but you can easily change it)

### Feel free to use these scripts for any purpose whatsoever without crediting me!
